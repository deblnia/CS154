-- PROBLEM 1 -- 

A. 
	OUTPUT LINE | PARENT/CHILD | SOURCE LINE | VALUE OF FORKRET 	
		1   |	P 	   | 	16       | 	0 
		2   | 	P 	   |	23 	 | 	101
		3   | 	C          | 	19 	 |  	0 
		4   |	P  	   | 	8        |	101
		5   | 	C 	   | 	8 	 |	101 
		6   |	C	   |    10 	 |      0
		7   |   P 	   |    26       |      101




B. 


	OUTPUT LINE | PARENT/CHILD | SOURCE LINE | VALUE OF FORKRET 	
		1   |	P 	   | 	16       | 	0 
		2   | 	P 	   |	23 	 | 	101
		3   | 	C          | 	19 	 |  	0 
		4   |	C  	   | 	8        |	0
		5   |	C	   |    10 	 |      0 
		6   |   P 	   |    26       |      101



The race condition that leads to this output instead of part A is in line 25 -- the wait puts the parent to sleep, which lets the child run.  


C. 


	OUTPUT LINE | PARENT/CHILD | SOURCE LINE | VALUE OF FORKRET 	
		1   |	P 	   | 	16       | 	0 
		2   | 	P 	   |	23 	 | 	101
		3   |	P  	   | 	8        |	101
		4   | 	P 	   | 	8 	 |	101
		5   |	P	   |    10 	 |      101 



The race condition that leads to this output instead of part A is also the wait -- the parent runs instead of the child in this instance.  



D.

 
	OUTPUT LINE | PARENT/CHILD | SOURCE LINE | VALUE OF FORKRET 	
		1   |	P 	   | 	16       | 	0 
		2   | 	C          | 	19 	 |  	0 
		3   |	C  	   | 	8        |	101
		4   | 	C 	   | 	8 	 |	0 
		5   |	C	   |    10 	 |      0 
		6   |   P 	   |    26       |      0



The race condition that leads to this output instead of part A is ______
