deblina hw1 grade: 14/18

Question 1 points and comments: 8/10


 -2 points:    if they made assumption about word size 
 (e.g. if students explicitly assume the integer to be 4/8/n bytes in their answers)

Ints are typically 4 or 8 bytes. 

If you wantto get the max, you should try bitshifting a 0xF 
by the (sizeof(int)-1 * 8)

Creative try though! Good luck ;)

Question 2 points and comments: 6/8
Close! For part D, you should be checking odd bits, not even ones (but the idea is right). Note that sizeof(int) gives size in bytes, not bits, for your part E.
