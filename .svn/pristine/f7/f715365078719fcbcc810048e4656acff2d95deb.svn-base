Question 2 points and comments: 5/5

B. We know from "leaq (%rax,%rax,5), %r8" that T is 6. Then, "imulq $60, %rdi,
%rax" gives ST = 60, so S = 10. Finally, "movq $1440, %rax" indicates the total
size is 1440, which is 4RST, so we can conclude that R = 6.

In your reasoning, "line 4: %r8 holds the value of (9 * j)", but it should be
6 * j here.

No points taken off as it's a bonus question
